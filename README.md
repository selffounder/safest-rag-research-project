# safest-rag-research-project

An open-source algorithm designed to create the **safest Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline.

**Ranked 2nd out of 100 research papers** in a recent research competition

Supports **Python** and **JavaScript** implementations.

## Hypothesis

### What's wrong with today's RAG systems?

Most RAG algorithms suffer from critical security vulnerabilities:
- Leakage of sensitive or proprietary data
- Unsafe storage and retrieval mechanisms
- Inadequate control over context injection

### Why now?

> Over 90% of modern companies are integrating AI agents into their workflows.  
> Yet, most ignore security until it's too late. This research aims to fill this gap.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/selffounder/safest-rag-research-project.git
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
SECURE_KEY=your-generated-security-key
```

Get your Groq API key [THERE](https://console.groq.com/home) 
Secure Key will be obtained after running encryption algorithm

# Add Your Data
Create a file named source_example1.md with the content you'd like to securely feed into the RAG system.
or you can use the example provided

# Possible Applications
This algorithm can be adapted for:

- Building safe AI agents

- Developing enterprise-grade AI copilots

- Auditing and improving existing RAG pipelines

- Educational and research purposes in LLM safety

# Papers & References
This work is part of a broader research effort focused on secure LLM infrastructure.
